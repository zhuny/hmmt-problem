# Axiom of Choice
## Statement
To any nonempty family $X$ whose elements are nonempty sets,
there exists a function called a _choice function_

$$f : X \rightarrow \bigcup_{X_i \in X} X_i$$

such that $f(X_i) \in X_i$ for all $X_i \in X$

Order by alphabet

1. (HMP) The Hausdorff Maximality Principle
2. (WOP) The Well-Ordering Principle
3. (ZL) Zorn's Lemma

## Prove
1. AC to HMP
2. HMP to ZL
3. ZL to WOP
4. WOP to AC
